This distribution algorithm uses a technique called Genetic Algorithm.
The Gen is represented as a list of lanes. Each index represents a vehicle and contains the number of the lane in which the vehicle should be allocated.
For example: [0, 1, 2] means that vehicle 1 will be allocated in lane 0, vehicle 2 in lane 1 and vehicle 3 in lane 2.
A lane represented with -1 means that the vehicle can not be allocated.
Index 0 represents the vehicle with the id #71.
Index 1 represents the vehicle with the id #72.
Index 2 represents the vehicle with the id #73.
Index 3 represents the vehicle with the id #74.
Index 4 represents the vehicle with the id #75.
